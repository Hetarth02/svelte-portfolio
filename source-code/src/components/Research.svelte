            A bird's eye view of anything is usually the first step to enter a
            new field of interest. The vast field of Data Visualisation might
            seem overwhelming at first, but a bird's eye view with this book
            might just be enough to nudge you over that cliff. We will try to go
            through every little detail about Data Visualisation, from its
            etymology all the way to its future enhancements. A detailed
            analysis of various Data Visualisation and representation techniques
            will be done in this book along with its various applications as
            well as the challenges, in enough detail to make it easier to grasp
            for new explorers of this field.
